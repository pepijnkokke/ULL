To run:
python2 segment.py --alpha {alpha} --phash {p#} -i {number of epochs} path/to/raw_corpus path/to/true_corpus
(see `python2 segment.py --help` for more information)

Boundaries get saved to 'boundaries.txt', ambiguous boundary evaluation gets
printed. Note that this code has not been thoroughly tested and is rather slow;
the code that was actually used for the report was written in C++ and can be found in segment.cpp
